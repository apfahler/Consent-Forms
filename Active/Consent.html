            <p class="consent-text-block">Please read this document carefully before you decide to participate in this research study. <b>Your
                participation is voluntary, and you can decline to participate, or withdraw consent at any time,
                with no consequences.  You must be 18 years or older to participate in this experiment.</b>

            <p class="consent-header">Study Title:</p>
            <p>Immediate memory revisited:testing the Sperling task with Peripheral Stimuli</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Person(s) conducting the research:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Brian Odegaard, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology 
                Email: bodegaard@ufl.edu
                Phone: 651-491-5897
            </p>
           
            <p class="consent-header">Purpose of the research study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">The primary purpose of this study is to examine how effectively you can identify and remember
                briefly-presented visual information.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">What you will be asked to do in the study: </p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to do the following things: (1) sit in front of a computer 
                monitor and try to remember as many items from briefly-presented grids of letters as possible; (2) sit or stand 
                in front of a table near a large projection screen and try to remember as many items as you can from briefly-presented grids of letters on the screen.
                All responses in this experiment will be completely anonymous.  
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Time required:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">One session, which can last up to 60 Minutes</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Risks and benefits:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study. The risk to participants
                would not exceed anything that a participant may experience in everyday life. Very similar
                studies have been conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Brian Odegaard and there have never been 
                any reported instances of discomfort. There are no direct benefits of participation to you, but you will be 
                contributing to scientific knowledge about how visual information is encoded and remembered.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Confidentiality:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Your information will be assigned a 
                code number, and your name will not be attached to your data in any way, thus ensuring that your 
                responses will be completely anonymous.  Your name will not be used in any report.

                Only the researchers will have access to the information we collect online. There is a minimal risk that 
                security of any online data may be breached, but since no identifying information will be collected, it is unlikely that a security 
                breach of the online data will result in any adverse consequence for you.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Compensation Policy:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Participants who will be participating in this study through SONA as part of the participation pool will 
                receive 2 course credit for the 60 minute study.</b>
